## TinySpHEAR with Zapnspark interfaces

The TinySpHEAR microphone is a traditional 4 capsule tetrahedral first order Ambisonics microphone. This improved design adds four printed circuit boards with Zapnspark phantom power interfaces housed in the microphone body. A trailing cable ends in four XLR connectors. The picture shows the full design as previewed in OpenSCAD and a picture of the second prototype (built with Primo EM182 10mm capsules, 9.6mm microphone radius).

The 3D models also include a shock mount that clips into a standard microphone stand mount. The two main model files are tuned for [EM182](../master/TinySpHEAR_EM182.scad "TinySpHEAR for 10mm EM182 capsules") (10mm) and [EM200](../master/TinySpHEAR_RM200.scad "TinySpHEAR for EM200 capsules") (14mm) capsules. Uncomment the different "render_" lines to render different parts or the complete microphone assembly.
